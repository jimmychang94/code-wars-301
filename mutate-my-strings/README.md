Here is the problem domain for today's kata:

  I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

  Example:

  stringOne = 'bubble gum';
  stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

  Result:
  bubble gum
  tubble gum
  turble gum
  turtle gum
  turtle hum
  turtle ham
